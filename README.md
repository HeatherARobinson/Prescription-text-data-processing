# Prescription-text-data-processing
Research Events Medication is a programme developed at The University of Manchester in conjunction with the Salford Integrated Records to parse textual prescription instructions to table format.

These codes have been developed considering unique prescription instructions present in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink and/or Salford Integrated Record for preliminary preparation of complex textual instructions prior to parsing through Research Events Medication, including expansions for PRN dosing, stop instructions relating to other prescribed drugs, aqueous, topical or inhalant medications and injectables.

Functionality has been integrated from Research Events Medication, and an updated regex file has been provided which can be added into the original PERL framework to expand matching capabilities or used with the accompanying R code. To use in conjunction with Research Events Medication, substitute for the existing regex file within the Resources folder.
