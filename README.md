# Prescription-text-data-processing
Research Events Medication is a programme developed at The University of Manchester in conjunction with the Salford Integrated Records to parse textual prescription instructions to table format.

These codes have been developed with the Clinical Practice Research Datalink for preliminary preparation of complex textual instructions prior to parsing through Research Events Medication, including expansions for PRN dosing, stop instructions relating to other prescribed drugs, aqueous, topical or inhalant medications and injectables.

An updated regex file has been provided to expand matching capabilities. To use in conjunction with Research Events Medication, substitute for the existing regex file within the Resources folder.
