#Prescription-text-data-processing
Research Events Medication is a programme developed at The University of Manchester in conjunction with the Salford Integrated Records to parse textual prescription instructions to table format.

The codes provided here have been developed to supplement Research Events Medication, considering unique prescription instructions present in the Clinical Practice Research Datalink and/or Salford Integrated Record for preliminary preparation of complex textual instructions prior to parsing through Research Events Medication, including expansions for PRN dosing, stop instructions relating to other prescribed drugs, aqueous, topical or inhalant medications and injectables.

Functionality has been integrated from Research Events Medication, and an updated regex file has been provided which can be added into the original PERL framework to expand matching capabilities or used with the accompanying R code. To use in conjunction with Research Events Medication, substitute for the existing regex file within the Resources folder.

Codes are provided in modules to enable integration with other unique challenges and solutions.


THE CODES WITHIN THIS REPO ARE IN PROGRESS.

IF YOU EDIT THESE CODES, PLEASE MARK AFTER EACH EDITED BLOCK IF THAT CODE IS NOW IN PROGRESS, OR IS TESTED AS FUNCTIONAL, THIS WILL ENABLE US TO QUICKLY MOVE FORWARDS.
